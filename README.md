Stefan is an accomplished and flexible developer who can easily switch between vastly different sets of technologies. During his 13-year career, this helped him learn to quickly adapt to new frameworks, tool sets, and languages while delivering professional quality products. He is a stickler for good UX, so expect beauty, performance, and functionality. His work is reliable, robust, and original. Stefan's current stack of choice is MERN.
