## Personal Projects

### Procedural Interactive Book

A PWA (progressive web application) that aims to present a novel experience, combining the visual minimalism of ''choose-your-own-adventure'' books with the openness of traditional computer games. On the surface, the app is text animated with Three.js and jQuery animations; behind the scenes, it blends scripted events and dialogue with procedural sentence generation (think "online chat-bots") and an AI narrative director orchestrating a modular story at a reasonable pace. AngularJS was used to build both the game client and a custom tool for editing all characters, locations, special events, and dialog/narration snippets.

### Collectible Card Game in React

On the client-side, this is a single-page web application written in TypeScript with React for rendering and GSAP combined with regular CSS handling most of the animation. The server consists of a simple Express.js app, utilizing Google's Firebase SDK for authentication and data persistence (Google's Firestore) and the beautiful and open-source Colyseus framework for room management and real-time communication. For administration, I created a card editor as a separate React app that uses simple forms, the ACE editor plugin for writing the card effects with syntax highlighting, and custom autocomplete. I opted to use the GitHub API for saving/loading data with added makeshift change history.

### Prototype Flutter App for Wear OS

A small prototype application utilizing built-in speech recognition and text-to-speech to send chat prompts to OpenAI and read out the response from their GPT4 model directly from your watch.

The app was built using Flutter, with minimal UI and animations.
